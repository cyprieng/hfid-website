        <h1> Needs Analysis </h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>Modified Design Brief </h2>
        <p> We are trying to make self-checkout machines more usable. As a result of the machines’ poor design, many shoppers prefer to checkout with a cashier or become frustrated when they do use self-checkout. </p>

        <p> In the self-checkout system, there are two main users: shoppers and store employees. Our system will be designed with both these groups’ needs and values in mind. </p>

        <p> Based on initial inquiries, prospective users like the idea of self-checkout but find many aspects of it flawed and difficult to use. Current self-checkout systems are meant to be fast, but extra unnecessary screens prevent the process from being streamlined. In addition, user errors usually result in an attendant accidentally being called over. This leads to more time being wasted, the user feeling like they are being an inconvenience, and the user feeling inadequate. Other recognized problems include annoying bagging processes, buying produce (or other things without barcodes), and using coupons with the system. </p>

        <p> We see several fundamental issues with self-checkout that a successful redesign must address. Shoppers should not “break” the system so easily, forcing the machine to call an attendant and embarrassing the user. Additionally, when a user really does need help it should be easy to call an attendant over. Produce and other items without bar codes should be easier to check. The bagging process should be more intuitive and less breakable. Employees should not spend so much of their time fixing mistakes. With a successful project, both shoppers and employees should view self-checkout as a wonderful convenience rather than a clumsy obstacle. </p>

        <p> The impact of a successful solution will be positive self-checkout experiences for both shoppers and employees. An improved system will save shoppers time by decreasing time spent during checkout. Additionally, it will decrease store costs by decreasing the number of cashiers needed during a shift. Ideally, we will aim to create an interface that will increase conversion to self-checkout. </p>

        <h2> Evidence Discovery </h2>
        <p> In order to appropriately evaluate the needs of users of our project, we visited three supermarkets: Shaws, Stop and Shop, and CVS. At each of these locations, we interviewed at least one floater (of the self-checkout system) and several customers. Interview observation and debrief is shown in Image 1. </p>

        <figure class="text-center">
          <a href="img/needs_analysis00.png"><img class="img-responsive img-mini" src="img/needs_analysis00.png"/></a>
          <figcaption>Image 1</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> We also surveyed personal and extended acquaintances over the internet on their sentiments of self-checkout. We then consolidated comments that were duplicated and sorted them into bagging complaints, unusable features, and positive components of self-checkout. This is shown in Image 2.</p>

        <figure class="text-center">
          <a href="img/needs_analysis03.png"><img class="img-responsive img-mini" src="img/needs_analysis03.png"/></a>
          <figcaption>Image 2</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> From this data, we then aimed to create personas that accurately represented the users of the self-checkout system. These personas help us to create needs that are not just based on one person or experience, which will later help inform the requirements of our interface designs. Just these three “people” can encapsulate hundreds of users.</p>

        <p>To find such groupings of users, we numbered each interviewed person (as seen in Image 1) and then plotted them on axis. Store attendants are represented with numbers in boxes for quick differentiation. We selected our axes based on traits that we saw strongly expressed in some users’ actions or statements.</p>

        <figure class="text-center">
          <a href="img/needs_analysis01.png"><img class="img-responsive img-mini" src="img/needs_analysis01.png"/></a>
          <figcaption>Image 3</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> We examined the clumping of shoppers first. The most immediate disparity is in the “Acceptance of the system” axis. Either users really want it to change (users 5, 3, and 2) or they are completely accepting (6 and 1). We see this same grouping again in “Liking the system” axis. Users 5 and 3 are clearly separated from 6 and 2. And again 5, 3, and 2 is separate from 6 in “Neediness” axis. It is important to note that these groupings are not static. Sometimes 1 is separate from 6. The purpose of personas is not to put each interviewed user into a bucket because some users have aspects of multiple personas. The purpose instead is to represent different opinions of multiple people. Therefore, these trends were able to form  the beginning of our two personas: Independent Ingrid and Forced Francis.</p>

        <figure class="text-center">
          <a href="img/needs_analysis04.png"><img class="img-responsive img-mini" src="img/needs_analysis04.png"/></a>
          <figcaption>Image 4</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> We then reexamined Image 3 while looking at store floaters and saw clear clumpings. A majority of floaters are neutral on the “Like it” axis, to the right in “Faith in the system” and “Acceptance of the System.” From these trends, we created a store floater persona called Present Patricia. </p>

        <figure class="text-center">
          <a href="img/needs_analysis02.png"><img class="img-responsive img-mini" src="img/needs_analysis02.png"/></a>
          <figcaption>Image 5</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> Therefore, by consolidating the needs from all of our personas, we have a distinct lists of needs for our improved self-checkout interface. These are listed below. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>a way to get in and out of the store quickly</li>
          <li>not be humiliated when attendant comes over</li>
          <li>sufficient information to do things himself</li>
          <li>transparency in spending</li>
          <li>ability to go through process without disruption</li>
          <li>ability to make her own choices</li>
          <li>make process as smooth as possible</li>
          <li>able to see a path of least resistance</li>
          <li>to feel positive about what she is doing</li>
          <li>to feel like she is doing something important</li>
          <li>to be treated and treat others with a smile</li>
          <li>to feel like she can trust others</li>
          <li>to know what she needs to know</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Limitations </h2>
        <p> It is important to note that these results step from a quick interview process spanning only two weeks. Given more time, it would be ideal to visit much more stores - especially in areas of varying economic background. In addition, more extended user interviews with customers would be recommended as well as adding store managers as a potential group to interview. </p>
