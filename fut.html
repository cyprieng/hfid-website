        <h1> Formal Usability Testing </h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>For the final phase of our design refinement, we interviewed two users using the formal usability test we designed. This test was created to test a major idea driving the design  of our prototype - whether users prefer simplicity over clear functionality. One major thing we noticed during this round of testing was that our ability to successfully test our prototype is blocked by our lack of a final hardware prototype. A large portion of the full interaction with our prototype would be done in conjunction with a physical system (scanners, scales, cameras, bad touchscreens, bagging areas). Because our users have not been able to interact with these parts of the system this round many users skipped over steps or were confused about parts of the prototype that otherwise make sense. Luckily, users did not focus on small errors that our prototype had in past iterations. Fixing all the minor spelling mistakes, misaligned text, and hard to read buttons made users focus more on the interactions and not the aesthetics of our prototype. Overall, it was very difficult to reach any solid conclusions from this very small round of testing. While one person was able to successfully rush through our prototype using aesthetically simpler icons/buttons, the other person stated they would not have realized the function of the changed buttons. </p>

        <h2>Response Variables</h2>
        <p>There were three response variables we kept track of for each usability test - time taken for task, number of questions asked, and number of incorrect actions. Each user was given four tasks to complete, with each task highlighting a specific change made to the prototype. For each task given to a user, each of these response variables were carefully documented. Obviously, these results are a little skewed because only two users were tested. </p>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interpretation of Variables</h2>
        <p>The results from the formal usability test were very different for each user. For User 1, the lack of a physical system was a huge hindrance and resulted in a lot of confusion. Beyond this problem, the change to more simplistic design aspects did not seem to help the user use our system. The user never used the keyboard icon, and then only reason their time was faster for the attendant icon was because they had used the “call for help” button first. In fact, the user specifically mentioned that this was why they knew how to call an attendant. For user two, the times to complete a task actually decreased with the addition of the keyboard button. This was because the simplified task was completed first, and the task with the keyboard button was completed next after the user had gained more knowledge on how to use the system. This user also shared that they only understood the attendant button because of using the call for help button previously. These results indicate there are inherent problems in the design of our usability test. While we initially wanted to use time as the main response variable, the time that it takes to complete a task is highly dependent on what order the tasks are completed in (previous tasks allow them to gain more experience and become faster). In addition, every tester will not take the same amount of time complete a task - some may just be complete actions slower, making it difficult to compare two users’ results to each other. </p>
        <p>If the results held with a larger user population, then one clear point that could be taken away is that “call for help” is much more informative than the icon of a person. This goes against our initial hypothesis that users would desire the slightly more simplified system. Additionally, the addition or lack of the keyboard icon would not greatly affect the overall interaction of the system. While the keyboard icon is nice for those that use technology constantly or are apologists, it does not significantly help the user interaction. </p>

        <h3>Future Goals </h3>
        <p>In the upcoming week we will to put the finishing touches on our prototype based on the usability testing and testing the prototype internally within the team. This will allow us to deliver a fully-realized prototype that could be used to convince a client of its value. We will be leaving the attendant button as saying “call for help” in order to be explicit about its functionality. In addition, we have decided to remove the keyboard from the produce identification page but not the produce selection page.This provides a way for expert users of competing actions faster in the system, but the keyboard is not bothersome to those that are new to the system. Finally, if we had more time, we would redo our usability test to not rely so heavily on time as a response variable.</p>
