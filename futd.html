        <hr>

        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>Users desire a simplified system rather than text/affordances indicating available options. </p>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>Below are three changing variables and three tasks. For each task, one variable of the same numeric value is changed. All other variables are kept the same. For example, the first user test would be Task 1 (check out a piece of produce) with Variable 1 (removed keyboard option). Thus there are three tests (with associated variable/tasks) that each user will perform: Test 1, Test 2, and Test 3.</p>

        <h2>Changing Variables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove keyboard option (for produce identification)</li>
            <li>Change “Call for Help” to attendant icon</li>
            <li>Add arrows to indicate scrolling ability (for scanned items)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>User must check out a piece of produce.<br/><i>“You are just getting an orange today and are using self checkout. Please purchase and pay for this item.”</i></li>
            <li>Assume produce identification is not working - neither video or keyboard. User must call the attendant.<br/><i>“You are getting strawberries today and using self checkout. Please purchase and pay for this item.”</i></li>
            <li>Preload the scanned items with many items. User must remove an item that requires scrolling to find.<br/><i>“Assume that you’ve scanned everything in this list. But now you decide you don’t want strawberries.”</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Constant Variables</h2>
        <p>All parts of the system except the current “changing variable” in the test will be kept constant. For example, text size, button locations, help text will all remain the same. </p>

        <h2>Response Variable(s)</h2>
        <p>In order to observe the effects of changing certain factors in our design, we will be measuring a couple of response variables. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Time to complete outlined task</li>
            <li>Number of attempted questions asked</li>
            <li>Number of incorrect actions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Time to complete outlined task will give us an idea of if the changed factors affect a user’s ability to efficiently use our system. We will also be keeping track of how much time was spent on each screen as part of this variable. Number of attempted questions asked will let us know if these changes affect the user’s understanding of the system. We will also be observing number of incorrect actions because a user could complete a task quickly, but make a lot of mistakes along the way. </p>

        <h2>Expected Results</h2>
        <p>If our hypothesis is correct, then implementing each of the proposed changes separately should decrease the time it takes a user to complete a task. The number of questions asked would not increase because users would still understand the system, despite changes made to simplify it. </p>

        <h2>Testing Notes</h2>
        <p>Ideally, we would perform user testing with at least nine users.  Each user would work through every test - but in different orders. For example, User 1 will perform Test 1, Test 2 and then Test 3 but User 2 will perform Test 3, Test 2 and then Test 1. Since there are three tests, there are six possible ordering of tests. Each permutation will be used for Users 1 through 6. The last three users will do the tests in an already used order - this will be chosen randomly.<br/><br/>Note: One member of our team has experience in designing controlled experiments.</p>
