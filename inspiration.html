        <h2>ATM </h2>
        <h3>By Greg Edelston </h3>
        <div style="float:right">
         <img src="img/ATM2.png">
       </div>
        <p> For all the flak they get, ATMs do a few things right. Unlike self-checkout machines, ATMs never require a human attendant, even though they are transacting potentially large sums of money; they are eventually able to dismiss the human without embarrassing them in front of another human. The need for human attendants (to confirm that checks are valid and the numbers provided are correct) is hidden behind a curtain – the user need never recognize the attendant’s existence. </p>
       <p>The information hierarchy of the ATM is a well-defined tree: it prompts you to put in a payment method, and then any of your operations will either be withdrawals, deposits, or transfers. At least at my Bank of America ATMs, I have always been able to find the function I want for with minimal friction. </p>

         <p>In more recent years, many banks have abstracted another level from ATMs. Many people would not deposit their checks or were unaware of their balance just because they would not want to make the arduous trek to an ATM. With mobile and online banking, most of the functionalities of an ATM have been made available on the go. </p>

         <h2>Krispy Kreme Donut Production </h2>
        <h3>By Allie Duncan </h3>
        <div style="float:right; margin-bottom:2rem;">
         <img src="img/krispy-kreme.png">
       </div>
        <p> The Krispy Kreme Donut Production line is build for efficiency and is usually the first thing people notice when entering a store. It is impressive because not one of the 270 donuts created per hour is wasted. It is important to note here that the donuts do not necessarily move extremely quickly - but they move at an expected rate and never delay. Finally, as of 1963, the entire creation donut process is performed without human intervention.</p>

          <p> The Krispy Kreme factory is inspirational because the process is streamlined and automated. There is never a point where there is a “build up” or standstill. Each donut continually moves. Self checkout should similarly have both a physical and interface design in which nothing holds the user up. Finally, the production line is completely autonomous. The user interface should be for purchases preferences and issue resolution. For example,  The user can enter information about him or herself, but not the groceries they are buying. This is usually where any stall occurs - because people do not know always know what type of grocery they are purchasing. (But they can quickly enter personal preferences or information.)</p>

         <h2>Venmo</h2>
        <h3>By Amanda Lee </h3>
        <div style="float:right">
         <img src="img/venmo.png">
       </div>
        <p> Venmo was created as a new, easy way to electronically (through phone or webapp) exchange money between friends. After initially connecting a venmo account to their bank account, users can quickly get started using all features of the app (including cashing out to their bank account). Venmo allows users to not worry about carrying cash and lets friends ask their owed money in a not awkward way. One of the problems with self-checkout systems is that there are tedious to use. When paying for groceries, you have to go through a number of screens - coupons, verification, system processing to finally complete your transaction. For users that want to quickly go through self-checkout, this can be annoying and unwelcome. Combining a quick payment option such as venmo with a self-checkout system would make the process more streamlined. A combined system such as this would be targeted towards more tech-savvy users that use self-checkout frequently. </p>

        <h2>Amazon.com</h2>
        <h3>By Cyprien Guillemot</h3>
        <div style="float:right">
         <img src="img/rsz_amazon.png">
       </div>
        <p> Nowadays, the use of online buying platform is becoming increasingly popular; therefore it is normal that traditional store draws inspiration from them. </p>

        <p> Amazon, the most famous online buying website is close to self-checkout: you add products in your cart, you check your order, and you pay. But on Amazon, the use is easier: we usually need only few clicks to place an order. All without friction nor intervention of a responsible if you do something ‘strange’ like cancelling an item. Also not the choice between dozens payment methods, or loyalty cards which lost the consumer. </p>

        <p> It would therefore be interesting to be inspired by Amazon even if they do not suffer the worst problem of self-checkout: theft, which leads to bad decision for interface in order to prevent it. </p>
